# Web Monetization Extension Test Plan

## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to guide end-user testing of the Web Monetization browser extension.

## Audience
Any person interested in testing the beta release of the Web Monetization extension. 
There is no requirement for technical competencies.

We focus on functional test cases, and the goal is to record and report the actual behaviour that was observed when it differs from the expected behaviour.

## Strategy
One of the strategic goals of the Interledger Foundation is to grow Web Monetization awareness and adoption such that there are 1,000 web monetized websites and 100,000 active Web Monetization users (by 31 December 2024).

One of the long-term goals is to grow Web Monetization adoption by a factor of 10, in the next 5 years (by December 2029) such that Web Monetization functionality is either native to the most widely used Web browsers, or readily available through browser extensions on Web browser stores and marketplaces.

## Objectives
1. Validating that, once installed, users can configure Web Monetization settings on the extension.
2. Validating that once the extension is successfully connected to a digital wallet, a user is able to.
3. For web monetized websites, verify that the monetization event gets triggered.

## Dependencies
### Digital Wallets
Web Monetization-enabled digital wallets are provided by licensed service providers who are regulated by the laws of the countries in which they operate. They provide digital wallets that can send or receive Web Monetization payments.

Wallet availability in a specific country, or availability in particular currency depends on the wallet provider.
To learn more, visit a specific wallet providerâ€™s website. Below are the available wallet providers: 
- [Fynbos](https://wallet.fynbos.app/wallet)
- [GateHub](https://gatehub.net/mobile)

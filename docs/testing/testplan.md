# Web Monetization Extension Test Plan

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to guide end-user testing of the Web Monetization browser extension.
We focus on functional test cases. The goal is to report bugs, issues or differences observed from the expected behavior.

## Audience

Any person interested in testing the beta release of the Web Monetization extension.

## Objectives

1. Validating that, once installed, users can configure Web Monetization settings on the extension.
2. Validating that once the extension is successfully connected to a digital wallet for sending payments, a user is able to configure payments or disconnect from the wallet.
3. Validating that the behavior of the extension meets expectations, and that it is correct when the extension facilitates paying a monetized web page.

## Dependencies

### Digital Wallets

The main prerequisite for sending or receiving Web Monetization payments is to have a Web Monetization-enabled digital wallet. Web Monetization-enabled digital wallets are provided by licensed service providers. The wallet providers are regulated by the laws of the countries in which they operate.

Below is a list of the available wallet providers if you want to use real money:

- [Fynbos](https://wallet.fynbos.app)
- [GateHub](https://gatehub.net)

Wallet availability in a specific country, or availability in particular currency depends on the wallet provider.  
We maintain a list of [Web Monetization compatible wallets](https://webmonetization.org/docs/resources/op-wallets/).

#### Test Digital Wallet

You have the option to use “play” money from the [Interledger Test Wallet application][testWallet]. Here you can set up a test account that is enabled for sending Web Monetization payments.

## Testing

### Environment and Software

This test plan covers scenarios where you, as a website visitor, want to pay web monetized sites.

1. Hardware: Any PC with internet access
2. Digital wallet: A Web Monetization enabled digital wallet from which payments will be made
3. Environment & software:  
   a. Any operating system (OS)  
   b. A Chromium-based Web browser (e.g. Chrome, Edge, Vivaldi, Brave) or Firefox

### Reporting Issues

1. Use any screen recording application to record the steps and results of your testing (e.g. Loom, Camtasia etc.).
2. File bugs or other issues, and monitor their status and resolution on [GitHub](https://github.com/interledger/web-monetization-extension/issues).
3. Join the `#webmonetization` channel on [Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/interledger/interledger-working-groups-slack).

### Prerequisites

Before you start testing, sign-up for a wallet:

1. The sign-up process depends on your digital wallet provider. Learn more from the [Dependencies](#Dependencies) section.
2. If you want to use a real wallet:  
   a. Your wallet provider will likely need to verify your identity (info: this process is mandated by the laws of each country, or jurisdiction).  
   b. The identity verification process depends on your wallet provider, and your location (info: this can be within hours or days).  
   c. Once your wallet provider completes all sign-up and verification processes, you should be able to:
   - Log into your digital wallet application.
   - Setup and manage your wallet accounts, currencies, balances etc.
   - Obtain the wallet address or payment pointer for your digital wallet.

### Test Playground

Use the [Web Monetization playground](https://webmonetization.org/play/) to quickly create the conditions of a monetized website in a playground area, to use only for testing purposes.

When you add a wallet address or payment pointer to the playground, it is added as a receiving wallet on the playground.  
So, the playground behaves like a monetized website on which you can use the Web Monetization extension to pay.

On the playground, you can add a wallet that uses real money from a real wallet, or you can add a wallet that uses “play” money from a “test wallet”.

**Important**

1. The playground itself is not web monetized. We do not receive any payments from you if you use this site.
2. The playground becomes monetized when you add one or more receiving wallet addresses to it.
3. If your Web Monetization extension is connected to a real wallet, then your extension will facilitate payments from your real wallet (i.e. real money).
4. Similarly, if your extension is connected to a [test wallet][testWallet], then the extension facilitates payments using "play" money.
5. If you add your own wallet address to the playground, and then use the extension to pay the playground, you are paying yourself.

### Test Data

This section lists examples of websites and Web Monetization compatible wallet addresses that you can pay using the Web Monetization extension.

- [roamancing.com/naturallyours](https://roamancing.com/naturallyours)

This website has multiple receiving wallet addresses. It can receive play money into a test wallet, real money into a Fynbos US wallet, and real money into a GateHub wallet.

### Functional Test Cases

These test cases are defined from the point of view of a website visitor that wants to use Web Monetization to pay.

#### Risk Areas

**Goal**: To lower the barriers to Web Monetization adoption.
**Approach**: Identify and prioritize risks to the adoption of the WM extension.
Based on these risks, the sections that follow will detail the actual test cases.

1. Open the extension, go to Settings, then go to the Rate tab.
2. Ensure that “**Continuous payment**” is enabled.
3. Use the slider to change the rate of pay per hour.
4. Go back to the main page of extension, and take note of the extension's remaining balance.
5. Spend some time, perhaps 3 to 5 minutes each, on a web monetized website and on a non-monetized website. On each site or page that you visit, open the extension to view the remaining balance on the extension.

**Expected results**:  
 | Web monetized websites | Non monetized websites |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |

#### Edge Test Cases

##### Partial one-time payment success

**Test ID**: 9  
**Description**: Make a one-time payment to a website that has multiple receiving wallets from different wallet providers, where some of the receiving wallets use real money, and some are test wallets that use "play" money.  
**Risk**: R3 (security of funds) and R4 (control my payments)  
**Preconditions**:

1. The extension is connected to your wallet.
2. Your extension has sufficient funds for the payment.
3. Your wallet has sufficient funds for the payment.

**Steps**:

1. Visit a monetized website that has multiple receiving wallet addresses or payment pointers:  
   a. You can visit [roamancing.com/naturallyours](https://roamancing.com/naturallyours/) because it has 6 different receiving wallet addresses, from different wallet providers.
2. Open the extension and make a one-time payment that is lower than the extension's available balance.
3. Visit a non-web monetized website, such as your favorite search engine. Open the extension to observe its available options.

**Expected results**:  
| Web monetized websites | Non monetized websites |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| Extension icon: ![active (full color), with a green tick](../../src/assets/icons/32x32/enabled-has-links.png) | Extension icon: ![active (full color), but with a red X](../../src/assets/icons/32x32/enabled-no-links.png) |
| Opening the extension displays: <ul><li>The hourly rate of pay, and the extension's remaining balance.</li><li>“**Send now**” button: clicking the button to send a one-time payment disables the button momentarily, until the extension shows a message that the payment succeeded, or that it failed (**please note**: a success or failure message for the payment is acceptable. This lets you know whether your wallet has been able to send funds to this web page).</li><li>The amount field remains unchanged with the value you had entered.</li><li>When you edit the amount, then the extension removes the message showing payment success failure.</li><li>**Balance**: the web page has 6 receiving wallet addresses, so the extension attempts to pay the maximum number of wallets it can pay, without exceeding its remaining balance. **Reason**: when you try to send $12 to the web page, the extension divides the total $12 amount by the 6 wallet addresses, such that it tries to send $2 to each receiving wallet on the page. **Observe**: only 1 of 6 payments can succeed, which should reduce the extension's remaining balance $2. </li></ol> | Opening the extension displays: <ul><li>This website is not monetized.</li></ul> |

##### Pay until the extension runs out of funds

**Test ID**: 10  
 **Description**: Make payments that deplete the extension funds to zero

3. There are enough funds in your wallet for the one-time payment you want to make.

**Steps**:

1. Visit a monetized website. The [Test Data](#Test-Data) section lists monetized websites that you can visit.
2. Open the extension to make as many payments as it takes to use up the remaining balance, until it is zero.
3. Visit a non-web monetized website, such as your favorite search engine. Open the extension to observe its available options.

**Expected results**:  
 | Visit monetized or non-monetized websites |
